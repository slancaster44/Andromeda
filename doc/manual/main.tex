    \section{Architectural Overview}\label{subsec:archetctural-overview}
    \subsection{Design Goals \& Inspiration}\label{subsec:design-goals-&-inspiration}
    \par The Andromeda 7400 was designed to be a simple computer that could be implemented in TTL logic.
    It takes heavy design inspirations from minicomputers of the mid 20th century, such as the
    DEC PDP-8.
    \par It uses single-address instructions, where one operand resides in an accumulator register, and the other is
    sourced from memory.
    The result of an operation is almost always stored in the accumulator.
    \par Due to its design inspiration, the instruction set is highly orthogonal.
    It includes twelve instructions with seven addressing modes.

    \subsection{Accumulator}\label{subsec:accumulator}
    \par The Accumulator is a 16-bit wide register.
    It serves as the an operand and result destination for all arithmetic operations, as well as the predicate for conditional jumps.

    \subsection{Memory}\label{subsec:memory}
    \par Memory is organized into 65536 16-bit words.
    The top-most page ($FF00_{16}$ - $FFFF_{16}$) is directly addressable by most instructions, as a result it
    is used to store the most commonly referenced global variables.
    \par Memory is only addressable in word sized units; memory is not byte addressable, as is common on other machines.

    \subsection{Instruction Format}\label{subsec:instruction-format}

    \end{center}
    \par Instructions are divided into three fields, the opcode, addressing mode and operand fields.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The Opcode Field (0-4): Indicates the operation to be performed on the data
        \item The Addressing Mode Field (5-7): Determines how the operand field will be used.
        The operand field can be used as an immediate value, or as an address to some other value in memory,
        depending on the addressing mode
        \item The Operand Field (8-15): An 8-bit constant that, in combination with the Addressing Mode Field, is
        used to determine the value to use in an operation.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Representing Numbers}\label{subsec:representing-numbers}
    \par All values will be stored in two's complement form.
    Addition and subtraction will both be two's complement operations.


    \subsection{Reset Sequence}\label{subsec:reset-sequence}
    \par While the machine is in reset, the reset line on the bus will be held low.
    After exiting reset, the Accumulator, Instruction Register and Program Counter will
    be set to zero.
    The machine will then begin executing code at address $0000_{16}$.


    \subsection{Invalid Instruction Trap}\label{subsec:invalid-instruction-trap}
    \par Should the machine encounter an invalid instruction, the machine will execute a JSR to address $0002_{16}$.
    That is, a pointer to the next instruction will be loaded into the accumulator, and $0002_{16}$ will be loaded
    into the program counter.
